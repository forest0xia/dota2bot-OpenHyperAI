# We Love Bot Games!

We love bot games! 🎮

> **\[CRITICAL]** To play this script you must create a **Custom Lobby** and select **Local Host** as the server location.

Bots should have names ending with **“.OHA”** when installed correctly.

Thanks and kudos to everyone who contributed to making bot games fun and exciting!

## Script Goals

1. Keep bot games **challenging and up to date**.
2. Let players **practice against bots** that can play *all* Dota 2 heroes.
3. Provide **chill gameplay** – if you want highly competitive bots, please join us in improving them instead of complaining.

---

## Why It’s Enjoyable

* ✅ Supports Dota 2 **Patch 7.39**.
* ✅ Supports **all 126 heroes** (Kez, Ringmaster, Invoker, Techies, Meepo, Lone Druid, Muerta, Primal Beast, etc.). Some new heroes are still being tuned.
* ✅ **Customizable bots**: ban/picks, names, item builds, skill upgrades, etc.

  * [Customize/general.lua](bots/Customize/general.lua) – general settings.
  * [Customize/hero/viper.lua](bots/Customize/hero/viper.lua) – hero-specific settings.
  * Path depends on install method:

    * **Workshop only**: `<Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570\3246316298\Customize>`
    * **Quick-install**: `<Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts\game\Customize>`
* ✅ **Dynamic difficulty (Fretbots mode)** – boosts bots with huge unfair advantages for real challenge.
* ✅ Supports **most game modes** (see [discussion](https://github.com/forest0xia/dota2bot-OpenHyperAI/discussions/72)).
* ✅ Improved decision-making: ability casting, items, roaming, farming, defense.
* ✅ **AI Chatbot**: chat with bots as if they were real optimistic players (requires Fretbots mode).
* ✅ Bots can **play any role/position** – deterministic laning assignment.
* ✅ Tons of **bug fixes** (idle bots, canceled channels, stuck states).

## How to Install

1. Create a **Custom Lobby** → select **Local Host** as **Server Location**.
2. To enable **Fretbots mode** (harder bots, neutral items, chatbot, etc.), you must **manually install** the script: [Instructions here](https://github.com/forest0xia/dota2bot-OpenHyperAI/discussions/68).

---

## Bot Roles & Positioning

* Lobby slot order = position assignment (1–5).
* Default role mapping:

  * **Pos1 & Pos5** → Safe Lane
  * **Pos2** → Mid Lane
  * **Pos3 & Pos4** → Offlane
* Customize picks, bans, and roles in [Customize/general.lua](bots/Customize/general.lua).

---

## In-Game Commands

* `!pos X` → Swap your lane/role with a bot (e.g., `!pos 2`).
* `!pick HERO_NAME` → Pick a hero for yourself.

  * `/all !pick HERO_NAME` → Pick hero for enemy.
  * Use internal names if the short names can overlap (`!pick npc_dota_hero_keeper_of_the_light`). [Find the list of internal names here](https://github.com/forest0xia/dota2bot-OpenHyperAI/discussions/71).
* `!Xpos Y` → Reassign other bots’ positions (e.g., `!3pos 5` to let the 3rd bot on the team play pos 5, do note it's the bot on the 3rd slot in the team not the bot that plays pos 3 at that moment).
* `!ban HERO_NAME` → Ban a hero from being picked.
* `!sp XX` → Set bot language (`!sp en`, `!sp zh`, `!sp ru`, `!sp ja`).
* **Batch commands** supported (e.g., `!pick io; !ban sniper`).

## Contribute

* Contributions welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/forest0xia/dota2bot-OpenHyperAI).
* Custom item/skill builds don’t need PRs – just tweak locally.
* Future development is in **TypeScript** for better maintainability.
* Project structure (bots, Funlib, Customize, BotLib, typescript, game)：
```

## What’s Next

* Current bot playstyle is limited by Valve’s API. **We need ML/LLM bots like OpenAI Five!**
* Planned improvements:

  * Smarter laning, pushing, ganking.
  * Stronger spell casting (Invoker, Rubick, Morph, etc.).
  * Better support for bugged heroes (Dark Willow, IO, Lone Druid, Muerta, etc.).
  * Full mode support + patch fixes.
* [Open feature requests](https://github.com/forest0xia/dota2bot-OpenHyperAI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%5BFeature+request%5D)
